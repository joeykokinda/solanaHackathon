## What is YouVest?

YouVest is a DeFi platform where you can discover and invest in emerging YouTube creators. Think of it as an early-stage stock market for content creators.

### The Problem
- Creators struggle to get funding in their early days
- Fans can't financially benefit from supporting creators they discover early
- No transparent way to value creator growth potential
- As an avid YouTube watcher, I can't invest in high-potential creators I discover

### The Solution
- **Tokenize Creators**: Each YouTuber gets their own SPL token on Solana
- **Bonding Curve Pricing**: Token price automatically adjusts based on supply and demand
- **Growth-Linked Value**: Token value tied to creator metrics (subscribers, views)
- **Instant Liquidity**: Buy or sell tokens anytime through the bonding curve

### How It Works

1. **Discover** - Browse early-stage YouTubers (that consent) using real YouTube API data, you must sign up to be here...
2. **Invest** - Buy creator tokens on Solana. Price increases as more people buy (bonding curve)
3. **Track** - Monitor token value as creators grow
4. **Trade** - Sell anytime for profit (or loss). Liquidity is built into the bonding curve

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Solana/Anchor)
- **Token Factory Program**: Creates SPL tokens for each verified creator
- **Bonding Curve Program**: Handles all buy/sell transactions with automatic price discovery using a quadratic bonding curve

### Backend (Node.js + Express) Hosted on Railway read mroe below
- RESTful API for creators, tokens, and transactions
- YouTube OAuth integration for creator verification
- YouTube Data API v3 integration for pulling subscriber/view counts
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- Cron job for periodic metrics updates

### Frontend (Next.js + React) Hosted on vercel read more below
- Landing page with creator discovery
- Individual creator profiles with charts
- Wallet integration (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
- Portfolio tracking for investors
- Token launch flow for creators

### Bonding Curve Formula
```
price = base_price + (tokens_soldÂ² Ã— curve_factor)
```
- **Base Price**: 0.000001 SOL (1,000 lamports)
- **Curve Factor**: Price increases quadratically with supply
- Simple and transparent - no complex multipliers
